# **ComplexityAnalyzer**

[![NuGet](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/ComplexityAnalyzer)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ComplexityAnalyzer)  
A lightweight .NET library for detecting algorithmic complexity in codebases, enabling developers to understand and optimize their codeâ€™s performance.

---

## **Overview**

ComplexityAnalyzer is a tool designed to help developers identify algorithmic complexity in .NET applications. Whether youâ€™re dealing with constant, linear, or exponential operations, this library analyzes your code and provides insights to improve its performance.  

### **Why Use ComplexityIQ?**
- Simplifies complexity analysis for .NET developers.
- Supports a wide range of complexity types.
- Lightweight and easy to integrate into your CI/CD pipeline.
- Provides telemetry for tracking usage and optimizing workflows.

---

## **Features**
- **Complexity Detection**: Identify O(1), O(log n), O(n), O(n log n), and beyond.
- **AST-Based Analysis**: Uses Abstract Syntax Trees for precise complexity detection.
- **Telemetry Integration**: Tracks usage patterns and provides performance metrics.
- **Extensible Design**: Easily add support for new complexity patterns.
- **NuGet Package**: Available for seamless integration into your .NET projects.

---

## **Installation**

Install ComplexityIQ via NuGet:  
```bash
dotnet add package ComplexityIQ
```

---

## **Usage**

### **Basic Usage**
```csharp
using ComplexityIQ;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        string codeSnippet = "int value = array[5];";
        string result = ComplexityDetector.Detect(codeSnippet);

        Console.WriteLine(result); // Outputs: O(1) - Constant Time Complexity Detected
    }
}
```

### **Unit Testing with MSTest**
```csharp
[TestClass]
public class ComplexityIQTests
{
    [TestMethod]
    public void Detect_ShouldReturnO1_WhenCodeContainsDirectArrayAccess()
    {
        string code = "int value = array[5];";
        string result = ComplexityDetector.Detect(code);

        Assert.AreEqual("O(1) - Constant Time Complexity Detected", result);
    }
}
```

## **Supported Complexities**
| Complexity      | Description                              | Examples                              |
|------------------|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **O(1)**         | Constant time complexity.                | Direct array access, single operations. |
| **O(log n)**     | Logarithmic complexity.                  | Binary search, divide-and-conquer.    |
| **O(n)**         | Linear complexity.                       | Single loops, single-pass operations. |
| **O(n log n)**   | Linearithmic complexity.                 | Merge sort, recursive divide-and-conquer. |
| **O(nÂ²)**        | Quadratic complexity.                    | Nested loops, brute force comparisons.|

## **Telemetry Integration**
Telemetry tracks:
- Usage patterns and detected complexity types.
- Performance metrics (e.g., analysis time, memory usage).
- Alerts for errors or anomalies.

Future updates will include detailed dashboards and CI/CD telemetry reports.

---

## **Roadmap**
- **Phase 1**: Constant time complexity detection (O(1)).
- **Phase 2**: Logarithmic complexity detection (O(log n)).
- **Phase 3**: Linear complexity detection (O(n)).
- **Phase 4**: Telemetry integration and linearithmic support (O(n log n)).
- Future support for exponential and factorial complexities.
